# app.log
Time tracking application and data log.

While still unnamed, this application is a data log and time tracking application. It's meant save a personal record of time spent on different tasks. A parser and application are planned as well. The parser to create a file which can be visually displayed, visualising data like total hours worked, percentage hours by projects, as well as a percentage ticker for total hours over lifetime. The application, while also dispaying the data, is meant to provide an interface for easily writing to the log file along with a few catches to easily fill out data for existing projects and to avoid data duplication or errors through typos.
